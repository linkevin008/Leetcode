You are given a 0-indexed array of unique strings words.

A palindrome pair is a pair of integers (i, j) such that:

0 <= i, j < words.length,
i != j, and
words[i] + words[j] (the concatenation of the two strings) is a palindrome.
Return an array of all the palindrome pairs of words.

You must write an algorithm with O(sum of words[i].length) runtime complexity.
